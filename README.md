# Logic-Equivalence-Checking-With-BDDs
An Assignment in VLSI CAD Part I: Logic Course under supervision of Rob A. Rutenbar, Adjunct Professor
We can use a BDD to determine if two gate-level networks are implementing the same function or not. And, if they are not the same, we can use the BDD to find an assignment of the variables that will make the network outputs different. In this problem, we will let you play with a real BDD package: kbdd from Prof. Randy Bryantâ€™s research group at Carnegie Mellon University (

)

To explain how to use kbdd, let us compare these two very simple logic networks:
